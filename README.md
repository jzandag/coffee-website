For the demanding coffee connoisseur who lives on the bleeding edge of technology, 
the XPRESSO is here to satisfy your needs. You can't control it via voice-recognition, 
but the connected web-based application has adjustments for ingredients' levels, preset combinations, 
and brewing schedule. If you're in a hurry, you can even select the last option that you've made.

The XPRESSO is a part of the reasearch proposal entitled Web Application-Controlled Electronic Variable Coffee Mixer 
that aims to develop a convenient ad efficent system of preparing coffee that will cater the needs of people with 
different coffee taste preferences by the use of an electroic variable coffee mixer controlled through a 
web application using a Raspberry Pi.
